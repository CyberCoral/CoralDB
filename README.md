# CoralDB
It's a mini Database Manager, which can help you in many tasks with manipulating databases with simple code and syntax.
It only uses two built-in modules (os, sys) and, in the last version of 27 / Dec / 2023, it only weighs less than 25KB.

# All the syntax parts and updates can be seen by selecting help_main() in shell or by reading help.txt, which if it is deleted you can download at this repository.

# The data is located in text files, beware of security issues if you use the last version (27 / 12 / 2023) seriously.
