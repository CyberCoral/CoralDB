# CoralDB
It's a mini Database Manager, which can help you in many tasks with manipulating databases with simple code and syntax.
It only uses three built-in modules (os, sys, re) and, in the last version of 27 / Dec / 2023, it only weighs 25KB.

# All the syntax parts and updates can be seen by selecting help_main() in shell or by reading help.txt, which if it is deleted you can download at this repository.
